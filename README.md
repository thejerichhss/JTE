# JTE
*JTE*, (or Jerich's Telnet Exploits) **is a Batch Coded Windows Executable that has all the best telnet websites.** (Disclaimer: You **need** to have "*Telnet Services*" installed, and put *JTE-Desktop* in *Desktop*.)
(PS: **RetrocampusWSL doesn't work, it loads the exact same as Windows. I am trying everything to resolve the issue. I am so sorry for the inconvience**)
